                <h2><em>Skull of Gul'Dan</em></h2>
                <p>The Skull of Gul'dan was a powerful demonic artifact created from the skull of the orc warlock Gul'dan. Used for a plethora of demonic activity, from opening portals to corrupting the northern forests of Ashenvale, its powers were finally consumed by Illidan Stormrage.
                    Although already consumed by Illidan, the skull still holds power and is in Illidan's possession.</p>
